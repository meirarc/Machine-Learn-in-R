# ‚öô How to Create Machine Learn Model in R language

In this article, I describe in a single project the steps to create and evaluate Machine Learn models in R, from the initial data analysis, data cleaning, transformation, and giving an additional analysis related to data balance and key data fields relevant for the Machine Learn models.

The main packages used in this article are Amelia, caret, ggplot2,  dplyr, reshape, randomForest and e1071

As part of the common structures of an R project like workspace preparation, packages installation I show you how to perform the following key things: 
	* General data view
	* Analysis, cleaning, and transformation
	* Convert Categorical / Qualitative Values

These initial steps are crucial to start the Machine Learn preparation regarding training and forecasting the results. For these activities I have several steps described in this article: 
	* Prepare training and test samples
	* Machine Learning Model v1 - Unbalanced Model
	* Machine Learning Model v2 - Balanced Model
	* Machine Learning Model v3 - Balanced Model + Relevant Variables

In the end, you will be able to save the model to your hard disk and start to share and use them to perform new forecasts.
